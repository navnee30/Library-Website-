            When searching for insights, efficiency is a priority. Being able to
            search a single, trustworthy and authoritative database saves
            valuable time that would otherwise be spent cross-checking multiple
            databases and having to confirm results. Since Scopus delivers the
            broadest overview of global, interdisciplinary scientific data and
            literature, across all research fields, researchers know that the
            odds of missing key research information are greatly reduced.<br />

            <a href="https://nptel.ac.in/">NPTEL</a><br />
            The National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) was
            initiated by seven Indian Institutes of Technology (Bombay, Delhi,
            Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Guwahati and Roorkee) along with the
            Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2003. Five core
            disciplines were identified, namely, civil engineering, computer
            science and engineering, electrical engineering, electronics and
            communication engineering and mechanical engineering and 235 courses
            in web/video format were developed in this phase. The main goal of
            NPTEL Phase II (2009-14) was to build on the engineering and core
            science courses launched previously in NPTEL Phase I. An additional
            600 web and video courses were created in all major branches of
            engineering, physical sciences at the undergraduate and postgraduate
            levels and management courses at the postgraduate level. Several
            improvements such as indexing of all video and web courses and
            keyword search were implemented
